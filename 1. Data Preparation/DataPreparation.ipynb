      "I have a very nice 2010 tundra with a near new engine with 10000 miles that I bought for my dad and I did a transmission service on it and thankfully after having it for 3 weeks blew up the transmission. So its getting a new one, it's around $3600 for the part. This truck low books at $18000 not taking a very low milage engine or brand new trans into account. No, the dirt bike is not included don't be stupid. Lmk if you're interested. Interior is near perfect.
